# Master-1---Economics---Thesis
Supplementary material for the thesis: "Modeling the relation between adaptation investment and public debt"

These files are here to reproduce the results of my thesis. There are divided in two files. 

**********************************************************************************************************
→ One file contains the mod.file to run on Dynare. 



**********************************************************************************************************
→ The second file contains the m.file to use in Matlab. They are here to reproduce the graphs shown in the thesis.



For tightfig.m, I retrieved the code from :
Richard Crozier (2022). tightfig(hfig) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34055-tightfig-hfig), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved June 30, 2022.
I only changed it very marginally to include the names of the variables and the x-axis.
